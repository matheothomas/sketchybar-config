# SketchyBar config

This is my personal SketchyBar configuration for MacOS, heavily inspired by [FelixKratz](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar) one.

## Requirements
- [SketchyBar](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar) 

## Installation
Clone the repo in `~/.config/` with :
```bash
cd ~/.config/
git clone https://github.com/matheothomas/sketchybar-config
```
